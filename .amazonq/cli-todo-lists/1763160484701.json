Tests cover success cases, error handling, filtering, and edge cases using mocks.","Successfully implemented unit testing with Jest! Created comprehensive test setup, working unit tests for matching service (86% coverage), and learned debugging test mocks. Coverage report shows 28% overall coverage with room for improvement.","Set up Firestore emulator configuration and created comprehensive integration tests for contact CRUD operations and matching workflow. Tests use supertest for real HTTP requests and emulated Firestore database.","Created comprehensive load testing suite with k6! Built load testing script simulating real user behavior (5-20 concurrent users) and performance benchmarking script with specific metrics for contact creation, matching, and retrieval operations."],"modified_files":["/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/package.json","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/tests/setup.ts","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/tests/unit/matching.service.test.ts","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/tests/unit/matching.service.simple.test.ts","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/package.json","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/firebase.json","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/firestore.rules","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/tests/integration/contact.api.test.ts","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/tests/load/contact-load-test.js","/Users/samuelgiraldoconcha/Documents/30X/investor-match-ai-api/services/contact-service/tests/load/performance-benchmark.js"],"id":"1763160484701"}
